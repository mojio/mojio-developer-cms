# REST API Basics#

The [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API can be used to create, read, update and delete resources. 

You can play with the REST API at [https://api.moj.io/swagger](https://api.moj.io/swagger).

### Authentication ###
The MojioAPIToken header must be included in all calls to the REST API. See the [Authorization section](#/content/cms.Getting_Started.Authorization) for more information on how to retrieve the Token.
