# Vehicle Simulator #

You can't always hop in your car and drive around whenever you want to test your applications so we have a [vehicle simulator](https://simulator.moj.io) to do the hard work for you. Even if you don't own a Vehicle or have a Mojio you can easily test out your application. 

Navigate to [https://simulator.moj.io](https://simulator.moj.io), sign in with your Mojio account, and follow the instructions. This will create and claim a test Mojio, create a test vehicle, and start generating trips for your account.

You don't have to do anything special to access this test data it will come up right along with any real life data that you have.
