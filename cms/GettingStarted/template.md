[Purpose: Non technical introduction]

We'll walk you through the basics of the Mojio Platform so you can get started building your very own connected car apps! We at Mojio use this very same API to build our own apps.

### The Ground Rules ###

Mojio gives you access to a great deal of data about the driver and their vehicle. The intent here is that you will create apps and services to improve the end user experience. We ask that you respect the end user, their overall app experience, and most importantly, their privacy.

Driving while distracted is now a leading cause of accidents. We're building the connected car to improve the overall user experience - please do so with safety in mind. Unlike other apps, Mojio apps know when the driver is behind the wheel. Please take extra care in ensuring that you do not distract the user when their focus should be on the road.

Finally, we want to help you build great apps. Our success is dependent on it. If there is anything we can do to make it easier to build car connected apps, please reach out to the Mojio team. 

#### In Summary: ####

* Respect user privacy.
* Consider driver safety when designing your apps.
* Provide a great end user experience.
* Build great car connected apps!
