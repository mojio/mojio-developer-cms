# Get Started #

Welcome to Mojio! 

This site will help get you on your way to connecting to the Mojio platform via our APIs. 

Mojio officially supports _iOS_, _Android_, _.Net_ and _JavaScript_ and has SDKs for each of these environments. If you do not use one of these environments, as long as your choice of development tools supports open technologies such as _HTTPS_, _REST_ and _WebSockets_, you will be able to integrate with Mojio.

## Some Basic Ground Rules ##

Mojio gives you access to a great deal of data about drivers and their vehicles. Our hope is that you will create apps and services to improve the end user experience and that you respect end users and safeguard their privacy.

Driving while distracted is now a leading cause of accidents. We are building the connected car to improve the overall user experience on the road. Please do so with safety in mind. Unlike other apps, Mojio apps know when drivers are behind the wheel. Please take extra care in ensuring that you do not distract users when their focus should be on the road.

Finally, we want to help you build great apps. If there is anything we can do to make it easier to build car connected apps, please reach out to the Mojio team.
